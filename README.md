## Introduction

Clearly state the purpose of this repository, including a description of how it fits into the broader goals of the NEON-biodiversity project as a whole.  

## Workflow

Provide a high-level overview of the steps in the workflow (e.g., Download raw data files, merge to monthly time scale, and calculate geodiversity statistics). 

## Spatiotemporal extent and resolution 

Describe the spatial and temporal extent and resolution of the data sets resulting from the workflow. For example:  
- Spatial extent: 81 NEON sites across North America
- Spatial resolution: 1 NEON site
- Temporal extent: 1950-2010
- Temporal resolution: Monthly average temperature and precipitation

## Usage

Specify which software and versions were used to create the scripts (e.g., R version 4.3.0). 

## Contributors

- List individuals or organizations involved in collecting, processing, and maintaining the Level 0 data.

## Contact Information
